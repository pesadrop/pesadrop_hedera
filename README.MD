# Pesadrop MVP (Hedera-Powered Micro-Investing Platform)

**Category**: Capital Markets | **Blockchain**: Hedera Hashgraph | **Stage**: MVP Development

## Overview
Pesadrop is a decentralized micro-investing platform based in Kenya, built on Hedera Hashgraph. The platform democratizes access to capital markets by enabling users to pool HBAR investments with minimal transaction fees and maximum scalability. Pesadrop allows users to create accounts, transfer funds for pool investments, and invest in fractional HBAR positions, all while leveraging the power of Hederaâ€™s fast and secure blockchain.

## Key Features

- **Account Creation**: Users can easily create accounts to participate in investment pools.
- **Fund Transfers**: Seamlessly transfer HBAR into investment pools and withdraw funds as needed.
- **Smart Contracts**: Pesadrop uses smart contracts to manage pooled investments, ensuring transparency, security, and efficiency. Once a predefined investment target is reached, the pool is deployed for further use.
- **Hedera Integration**: Built on Hederaâ€™s enterprise-grade Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT), the platform benefits from low transaction fees (<$0.01 per transaction) and 10,000 transactions per second (TPS), making it ideal for micro-investing.
- **Kenya-Based**: Focused on addressing the needs of the Kenyan market, while also providing access to global capital markets.

### Backend
- **Hedera Integration**: Users can create and manage Hedera accounts using the Hedera JS SDK, enabling seamless wallet interactions for both Kenyan and international users.
For this product demo,The process begins by creating two user accounts on the platform. Each user will receive a specific amount of HBAR to start with.

Here is hashscan links to both accounts

One user will receive 10 HBAR, while the other receives 5 HBAR.

Now that both users have accounts and balances, one user can transfer a portion of their HBAR to the other user. For instance, User 1 might send 0.5 HBAR to User 2. This transaction facilitates the pooling of funds for investment.

- **Escrow System**: Investment pools are managed through Hedera Smart Contracts (HIP-482), which handle deposits, withdrawals, and the deployment of funds once the target amount is reached.
- **Auto-Invest**: Threshold-triggered transactions using Hedera Scheduled Transactions ensure automated investments once a pool reaches the target amount.
- **Analytics**: Mirror node queries are used for real-time tracking of pool investments and transaction history.

### Smart Contract
- **HBAR Pool Smart Contract**: A Solidity-based contract that manages pooled HBAR investments. Key features include:
  - **Deposit Funds**: Users can deposit HBAR into a pool until the target is met.
  - **Withdraw Funds**: Users can withdraw their contributions before the target is reached.
  - **Deploy Pool**: Once the target amount is deposited, the pool can be deployed for investment use by the owner.
